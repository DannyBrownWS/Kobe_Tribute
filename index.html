            <h3 id="growing-up">Growing Up (1978-1996)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Kobe Bean Bryant was born on August 23, 1978.</li>
              <li>His father, Joe "Jellybean" Bryant, was an NBA player until Kobe was 6, when the family moved to Italy for the senior Bryant to continue his basketball career.</li>
              <li>Kobe lived in Italy until he was 13, becoming fluent in Italian, and falling in love with basketball, as he spent much of his time around his father's professional team.</li>
            <li>After moving back to the USA, Kobe's basketball career began to take off. By his senior year, he grew to 6'6" and was the top high school basketball player in the entire country.
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="divider-three"></div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="a-young-star">A Young Star (1996-1999)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Forgoing college, Kobe became just the 6th high school player selected to the NBA draft. He was selected as the 13th overall pick in 1996, and immediately traded to the Los Angeles Lakers.</li>
              <li>Taking the NBA by storm alongside his newly-acquired superstar teammate Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe won the NBA Slam Dunk contest his rookie year. He became the youngest ever to start an NBA game, and finished the season with All-Rookie 2nd team honors.</li>
              <li>In his second year, Kobe was named an All-Star starter, also the youngest to earn that achievement. There, he matched up head-to-head with Michael Jordan, as comparisons began to heat up between the young star and the player then regarded as the greatest basketball player of all time.</li>
              <li>By the middle of his third year during the 1998-99 season, he was accepted as a future superstar, and signed a 6-year contract to stay with the Lakers.
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="divider-three"></div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="shaq-and-frobe">Shaq and Frobe (1999-2002)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>To begin his fourth season, Kobe and his partner Shaq were joined by legendary coach Phil Jackson. Jackson was the coach for the Bulls two three-peat championship seasons, led by none other than Michael Jordan.</li>
              <li>The duo, and the team, took things to a whole new level of success, thanks to the help of their coach. The 1999-2000 Lakers finished with 67 wins (tied-5th most all time). Shaq was awarded regular season MVP, and Kobe was named both Second Team All-NBA and All-NBA Defensive Team - the youngest to be given defensive honors.</li>
              <li>Best of all, the Los Angeles Lakers won the 2000 NBA Championship. But not just that - they went on to three-peat, winning in both 2001 and 2002 as well. They became just the fifth team to three-peat in NBA history.</li>
              <li>Despite nearly unparalleled success, not all was well in Lakerland. Shaq and Kobe would become remembered as a top-5 duo of all time, but their interpersonal tension became public. And worse, Kobe's own reputation came to be damaged, forever.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
          <div class="divider-three"></div>
          <div>
            <h3 id="valleys-and-peaks">Valleys and Peaks (2002-2007)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The next season, Kobe finished top-3 in MVP voting for the first time, but the Lakers fell short of winning a fourth championship in a row. But it was the summer afterwards that changed everything.</li>
              <li>Over the Fourth of July weekend, 2003, Kobe was arrested for sexual assault. Kobe admitted to the adulterous encounter, but held it was consensual. Nonetheless, his sponsorships were revoked, and his reputation tanked.</li>
              <li>Throughout the 2003-2004 season, amid a smattering of Kobe's court appearances, the Lakers amounted to nothing spectacular. After the season, Shaq was traded away, thus ending the preeminent dynasty, even while Kobe extended his Lakers contract for another 7 years. Phil Jackson also left the Lakers, writing a revealing book on the way out, including a strong critique of Kobe for his on-court and off-court issues.</li>
              <li>By September 2004, the criminal case had been dropped, due to the accuser's unwillingness to testify. However, she opened a civil case against Kobe, which was settled out of court in March 2005 for likely a substantial amount. If you'd like to read more about the sexual assault case, you can click <a id="tribute-link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/sports/basketball/kobe-bryant-rape-case.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
              <li>Throughout the off-court issues, Kobe's personal star continued to rise on-court amidst a much-depleted Lakers team. He prevailed to lead the league in scoring twice during the 2005-2006 and 2006-2007 seasons (of which Phil Jackson had rejoined the team for). His crown achievment was scoring 81 points in a single game, the second-most all time.</li>
              <li>Although the Lakers achieved nothing of note during this time, due to Kobe's spectacular individual performance, his sponsorships gradually came back, and many fans and commentators moved on from debates about the sexual assault case, and chose to simply enjoy his greatness.</li>
            </ul>

          <div>
            <h3 id="black-mamba">Black Mamba (2007-2010)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>After facing intense scrutiny for his sexual assault case, as well as the implosion of the dynasty on his team, Kobe sought to reinvent himself. He began calling himself the "Black Mamba", a sort of deadly assassin on the basketball court.</li>
              <li>By the start of the 2006-2007 season, his nickname had begun catching on. He also changed to a new jersey number before the season began. And by the time another forgettable Lakers season ended, the Black Mamba took to the media to get serious about winning.</li>
              <li>In the summer of 2007, Kobe requested a trade from the Lakers. He had enough of losing, enough of the misery. The Lakers didn't trade him, but it marked the beginning of the new chapter for Kobe and the Lakers.</li>
              <li>In the middle of the 2007-2008 season, the Lakers traded for Spanish star Pau Gasol. The pair bonded over their European roots, being that Kobe had also gradually learned Spanish in addition to Italian. A rejuvenated and focused Kobe capped off the regular season by winning his first and only MVP award.</li>
              <li>In the 2008 post-season, Kobe and Pau, cryptically speaking Spanish to one another on the court, took the Lakers to the NBA finals for the first time since Kobe's previous dynasty. Losing handily to the Boston Celtics, while reinvigorating an ancient rivalry, Kobe and the Lakers felt confident moving forward. Kobe took his dominance to the Olympics that summer, where he, as the undisputed leader of Team USA, took his country to the Gold medal (also winning in 2012), beating teammate Pau in the final match to do so.</li>
              <li>The Lakers went on to win the next 2 championships, first against the Orlando Magic in 2009, and then in 2010, taking revenge against those Celtics. Kobe was awarded finals MVP in both of them, cementing the Black Mamba as a basketball hero, capable of leading a team to greatness.</li>
              <li>His Black Mamba legacy was defined by his play on the court as well as his mentality off it. On the court throughout those 3 years, he became famous for a certain face he'd make after a good play, showing intensity and ferocity. Off the court, he was known for his obssessive work ethic, putting in more hours than anybody else.</li>
              <li>During the 2009 Finals, after going up 2-0 against the Magic, a reporter asked him if he was happy about the series lead. "What's there to be happy about?" Kobe replied, stone-faced. "Job's not finished. Job finished? I don't think so."

            <h3 id="vino">Vino (2010-2014)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>The Lakers followed up their repeat championship with two good regular seasons in 2010-2011 and 2011-2012, but failed to make any noise in the playoffs. Phil Jackson left the team for good after 2011, and chemistry issues with new players as well as injuries to the team brought the sky-high Lakers back to the ground.</li>
              <li>Despite the team's gradually decreasing success, Kobe's individual play maintained at a superstar status. The two aformentioned seasons were his age 32 and 33 seasons, an age when many players at the time began to decline. Kobe thus assigned himself a new nickname: "Vino", Spanish and Italian for wine.</li>
              <li>Kobe took to Twitter to promote his new nickname, using the hashtag #vino to do so. He also became known on Twitter for providing unwarranted wisdom to other NBA players, even giving challenges to individual players to reach for higher goals than they had ever met.</li>
              <li>In his age 34 season in 2012-2013, Kobe continued to dominate individually. But it all came crashing down, when near the end of the season, he tore his Achilles tendon. Kobe heroically finished his two free throws, then walked off the court under his own power. Like Achilles himself, Kobe's decline could only have been brought about by injury.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="retirement">Retirement (2014-2020)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>After tearing his Achilles, Kobe never returned to form. His last 3 seasons carried much difficulty and frustration for Kobe and the Lakers. It all came to a head when he announced his retirement at the start of the 2015-2016 season.</li>
              <li>Kobe's retirement tour saw fans from all around the world coming to see him play one last time. Even on the road, the stadiums seemed to be filled with more Kobe jerseys than anything else. It was a testament to people's admiration for who Kobe was as a person and a basketball player.</li>
              <li>His final NBA game ended in fairy tale fashion. He scored 60 points, needing every one of them to win, which the Lakers did. Kobe retired as having scored the third-most points of all time in NBA history.</li>
              <li>Retirement for Kobe was only from the game of basketball. He wasted no time with his other pursuits, launching a venture capital firm not 5 months after his final game. Kobe also became a regular speaker at tech and entrepreneur conferences, proving that he wasn't just a rich athlete with money to spend. His "Mamba Mentality" was shifting in real time from sports to business.</li>
              <li>2018 was a big year for post-NBA Kobe. He published an autobiography on his NBA career. He launched a joint athletic-training business venture. Best of all, he won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film, <em>Dear Basketball.</em></li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="death">Death (2020)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Kobe's final public appearance was on December 29, 2019. He sat courtside at a Lakers game with his daughter Gigi, his 14-year-old middle daughter who was developing her own passion for basketball. Because of his 3 daughters, Kobe had become somewhat of a champion for women's basketball, evidenced by his rocking of an orange WNBA hoodie that night.</li>
              <li>Kobe and Gigi watched the LeBron James-led Lakers win that night, and shared a brief moment with LeBron during the game. A few weeks later, on January 25, LeBron passed Kobe on the all-time scoring list, bumping Kobe down to fourth. And the next day, January 26, 2020, Kobe and Gigi tragically passed away in a helicopter crash, along with 7 others.</li>
              <li>His death sent shockwaves throughout the world. Memorials popped up in every major city. The NBA cancelled the following Lakers game to allow time for grief. Years later, people still often react in disbelief to how Kobe died, remembering where they were when they found out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 id="legacy">Legacy (Present)</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Kobe Bryant led an incredible NBA career, there is no mistaking that. He finished with 15 All-NBA awards (tied-most all-time), 12 All-Defense selections (second-most all-time), 18 All-Star selections (third-most all-time), and 4 All-Star MVP awards (tied-most all-time). The All-Star MVP award was posthumously named after him. He is considered by many to be the player who came closest to emulating Michael Jordan, often regarded as the best player of all time and a top-10 NBA player of all time.</li>
              <li>Among more frivoulous cultural remembrances such as yelling "Kobe!" when one throws some trash into a trash can, he is also remembered well for his signature Mamba Mentality. In an interview for his book, Kobe remarked, “Mamba Mentality is all about focusing on the process and trusting in the hard work when it matters most. It’s the ultimate mantra for the competitive spirit... and it's grown into something athletes — and even non-athletes -- embrace as a mindset."</li>
              <li>But as we know, Kobe's sage-like ascendance in the NBA and pop culture came in the form of a phoenix rising from the ashes of his own mistakes. His death coming amidst the #MeToo movement of supporting and believing survivors of sexual assault renewed condemnation of Kobe's past.</li>
              <li>Although the details of his own sexual assault case may never be known, and did not end with a criminal conviction, many still view Kobe as having committed an unforgiveable sin. And others feel that the result of the case vindicated him of wrongdoing. Still a great many more feel uncertain as to how that chapter of his life leaves the legacy of an otherwise remarkable person.</li>
              <li>But no matter where we stand on this matter, it is clear that Kobe made an indelible mark on the world.</li>
              <li>In memoriam, Kobe Bean Bryant, August 23, 1978 - January 26, 2020.</li>
